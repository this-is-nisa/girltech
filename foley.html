<p>My name is Lizette Foley, and I am an Instructional Technologist at St. Thomas Aquinas High School. I graduated from the University of Miami where I was a Kappa Kappa Gamma and a cheerleader.

This is how I met my husband. We now have a beach volleyball court in my backyard.</p>
<p>I love to travel though I don't do it very often, but I have been preparing my whole life to travel by learning as many languages as I can. So far, I speak Spanish, French, and Italian. I practice often with Duolingo.</p>
